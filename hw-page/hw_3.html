	<h4>Graph Explanation and finding</h4>
	<p>It is assumed that students' talent is measure by the score-instructing time ratio, which is Average Score divide by Instruction Time.</p>
	<p>In this graph, the red line is the average ratio of all the countries. So we can see Russian, Korea, China(Hong Kong, Taipei), Japan are below the average line. These countries' students have good talent in math study. On the other hand, the countries like Yeman, Morocco, Tunisia are below the line. These countries' students seems not good at math according this measurement.</p>
