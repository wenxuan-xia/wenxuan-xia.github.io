	<h5><strong>Total Evaluation Standard:</strong></h5>
	<p>I use total = GPA/4 + (GRE_V-130)/40 + (GRE_Q-130)/40 + Essay/6 + Recom/10 to determine total score. All parts are regarded to have same importance. So I simply calculate <strong>every percentile</strong> of total score, and adds them up.</p>
	<p>What's more, I assume the upbound of Recom is 10.</p>
	<p><strong>The ranking algorithm:</strong> Using bubble-sort to find the ranking according to total score. And then, sort them back according to my seq-mark.</p>
